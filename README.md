# Building

1. install `Python 3.5+` and `pip3` (and `git` if you haven't already)
    > **Note**: Python 3.5 is the version that HPX is tested and being developed on. It should also work on 3.6 and up but no guarantees.
2. run: `python3 bootstrap.py`
    > **Windows users**: If you get `error: command '..\cl.exe' failed with exit status 2`, download `bitarray` from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/%7Egohlke/pythonlibs/#bitarray)
    > **Install like this**: `.\env\Scripts\pip3.exe install bitarray.whl`
